# SMPST
SMPST stands for Simple Mersenne Prime Search Tool.
# How to run:
## On linux download the executable from the releases tab, go in the folder it is and run ./smps
# Windows users will have to wait until it supports windows
## TIP: if you are a windows user and want it now you can setup WSL (windows subsystem for linux) with the following command
`wsl --install`
## which will download a Ubuntu subsystem on your machine. Or if you want a specific distro do
`wsl --install -d <Distro>`
## and replace the <Distro> with the name of the distro you want
